# Note generator from template 

## Basics:
The first thing you need to do is update the ´´´NOTES_PATH´´´ and ´´´TEMPLATE_PATH´´´ with your personal preference.
- You can add any template that you want with the next format <templateName>.md. Then you can use the name as a terminal argument with the -t to create a new note with that template. The default is 'diaria'.
